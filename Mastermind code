#Python

# Project Description:

# This program will play the game mastermind with one player and the computer being the codemaker. The computer will
# randomly pick a combination of four colored pegs that the player has to figure out in the right order. The player will have
# 6 colors, 0 to 5, to choose from, that can repeat, has to guess what the code of colored pegs is given the hints after
# each guess. The hints are 1 and 2 where 1 means one of the peg guesses is the correct color but in the wrong position
# and 2 means one of the colors peg guesses is the correct color and in the correct position. These hints will not be in the
# right order according to the peg guesses. The player has ten guesses.


# General Solution:

# Have a four peg code be randomly generated. Show what number is what color and have the player guess 4 colors for
# the four pegs in the code. Then display the code the player is guessing  and the clue they get and how many guesses the
# player has. Then repeat through the player guessing till the player guesses correct or they use up all ten guesses.


# Pseudocode:

# While playing is true
#   The computer will randomly choose a combination of four colored pegs for the code
#   Print out that the secret code has been chosen and that the player has 10 trys
#   While the code is unknown and the player hasn't used all their guesses
#       If the numebr of guesses is less then 10
#           Print the number of guesses left
#       Print out the numbers that corespond with the colors that can be chosen
#       Have the player guess 4 colors for the code
#       Print the players guess
#       Subtract 1 from the number of guesses
#       Loop through the 4 colors of the guess
#           If a color in the guess is a color in the code
#               If the color is in the right position
#                   Clue is 2
#               Clue is 1
#               If the guess is the same as the code
#                   The code is known
#       Print out the clues
#   If the code is known
#       Print "Correct" and how many guesses it took to find the code
#   Else
#       Print "No more guesses, the hidden colors were:"
#       Print the code
#   Get input if the player wants to play again
#   If player input is Y
#       Playing is true
#   Else
#       Playing is false
# Print "Thankyou for playing. Good-bye"
